            Hi, Iâ€™m Michael! A dedicated, team-oriented student with extensive
            experience in team leadership, conflict resolution and project
            management. When I am not in class, I enjoy working on side projects
            to solve complex, everday problems to apply and further my learning.
            I am a diligent, ambitious individual and I am eager to build on my
            academic foundation in computer science through real-world
            experiences.

          <p className="p">
            I am currently a management engineering student at the University of
            Waterloo. Management engineering is a unique, interdisciplinary
            program primarily focusing on computer science, industrial
            engineering, and management sciences to optimize processes in any
            organization. Being the only program of its kind in Canada,
            management engineering produces a degree suitable for a career in
            any industry.
