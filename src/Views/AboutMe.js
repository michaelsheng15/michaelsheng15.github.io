            Hi, Iâ€™m Michael! A dedicated, team-oriented student with extensive
            experience in full stack web applications and web services. When I am not in class, I enjoy working on side projects
            to solve complex, everday problems to apply and further my learning.
            I am a diligent, ambitious individual and I am eager to build on my
            academic foundation in computer science through real-world
            experiences.
